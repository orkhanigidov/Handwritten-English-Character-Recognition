# Handwritten English Character Recognition Based on Convolutional Neural Network

I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve the results of the project. Convolutional Neural Networks are used and trained in a supervised mode. CNN is a suitable and efficient technique for the proposed project which is the recognition of handwritten text. EMNIST Letters dataset has been used in the project. It has 145600 Handwritten English Characters. Several optimization methodologies are imported for improving the performance of CNN. The proposed CNN is giving an average of 93% accuracy on testing data.
